Python-based OverlappingAMR HDF5 reader and writer
##################################################

This is an pure Python (using ``numpy`` and ``h5py`` only) implementation for
the HDF5-based vtkOverlappingAMR file format reader and writer. The official
C++ VTK library contains a reader for the same format in the
``vtkHDFReader`` `class <https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkHDFReader.html>`_
but there are no corresponding writer in the VTK library.

The code can either be imported as a module in a Python program, used as a
command line converter or used as a Python-plugin in recent Paraview
versions (given support for Python is present and the packages ``h5py`` and
``numpy`` is installed).

The implementation has the following limitations:

1.  Only the first grid on the first level is interrogated to find which data
    arrays to write out. All arrays must be present on all grids on all levels.

2.  Arrays with character datatype are silently skipped (vtk ``numpy_support``
    does not handle character arrays very good).

3.  Arrays with zero elements are silently skipped.

4.  The implementation create a memory buffer for each data array, fills this
    buffer completely and flushes it to disk for each complete array and level
    for maximum performance. This might consume a lot of memory.

************
Installation
************

The only thing you need is the file ``PythonAMRHDF.py``. This file serve
both as a Python module that can be imported (``import PythonAMRHDF``),
a Paraview plugin ("Tools" -> "Manage Plugins..." -> "Load New") and a
standalone CLI converter tool (``./PythonAMRHDF.py --help``).

It is also possible to install it as a Python package. In that case you need
setuptools version 61.0 or greater, and the easiest is to install it directly
from Github:
``pip install git+https://github.com/kmturbulenz/PythonAMRHDF.git``

If you checkout the repository you can also install it in editable mode:
``pip install -e .`` or as an ordinary package with ``pip install .``.

In the main directory of the repository, run ``flake8`` and
``python3 -m pytest``.
